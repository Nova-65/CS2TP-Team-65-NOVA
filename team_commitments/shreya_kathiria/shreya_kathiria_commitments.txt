NOVA Project Overview: Shreya Manojbhai Kathiria (UI/UX Designer / Front-End Developer) 

Role Summary
As UI/UX Designer and Front-End Developer, I design the layout and navigation of the main product pages and translate them into HTML/CSS structures.

Products Dashboard Layout
- Grid of perfume cards displaying image, name, price, and quick-view link.
- Filter bar for category and price range at the top of the page.
- Search bar placed prominently to support the “Browse and View Products” use case.

Navigation & Flow
- From this page users can:
  - Open product_details for more information.
  - Add items to the shopping_cart.
  - Return to home or navigate to other sections via the navbar.

Visual Design Notes
- Use consistent card sizes and spacing between rows and columns.
- Apply NOVA brand colours to buttons (e.g. “Add to Cart”) and headings.
- Maintain a balanced layout with sufficient whitespace for a luxury feel.
