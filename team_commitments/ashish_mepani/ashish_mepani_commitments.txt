NOVA Project Overview: Ashish Mepani (Front-End Integration Engineer / Report Contributor)

Role Summary
As Front-End Integration Engineer, I focus on connecting the UI elements with the back-end logic and documenting how data should flow between them.

Login / Log Out Behaviour
- The login page should send email and password to the back-end authentication script.
- On successful login, users are redirected to home or products_dashboard.
- The logout option should clear the session and return the user to the home or login page.

Front-End to Back-End Data Flow
- Form fields:
  - email – user’s registered email address.
  - password – user’s password.
- Expected responses from the server:
  - Success message and redirect URL.
  - Error message for invalid credentials or missing fields.

Report Contribution Notes
- Documented the “Account Management” customer use case in Section 5.
- Helped describe how the front-end forms will connect to back-end PHP scripts during TP1.
