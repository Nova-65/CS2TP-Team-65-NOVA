NOVA Project Overview: Robel Gashu (GitHub Repository Manager / Security Engineer)

Role Summary
As GitHub Repository Manager and Security Engineer, I manage version control and plan core security practices for the NOVA project.

Repository Management
- Created and organised main folders: frontend, backend, database, docs, media.
- Encouraged each team member to commit at least one role-related file.
- Monitored commit history to keep changes traceable and consistent.

Planned Security Practices
- Use PHP password hashing functions for storing user passwords.
- Validate and sanitise all input from registration, login, and checkout forms.
- Restrict admin pages (admin_products, admin_orders, admin_promotions, admin_profile) to authenticated admins only.

Future Tasks
- Review pull requests for security concerns once coding begins.
- Help document any security-related changes in the report and Trello.
