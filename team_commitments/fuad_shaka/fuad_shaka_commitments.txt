NOVA Project Overview: Fuad Shaka (System Integration Engineer / Back-End Developer)

Role Summary
As System Integration Engineer and Back-End Developer, I plan how PHP scripts will interact with the database to support secure checkout.


1. Retrieve the current user’s shopping_cart items from the database.
2. Calculate subtotal, shipping (if applicable), and final total.
3. Validate delivery details submitted from the checkout form.
4. Create an order record and related order_items entries.
5. Return a confirmation message and order reference.

Security & Validation
- All inputs will be validated on the server before creating any records.
- Prepared statements will be used to prevent SQL injection.
- Only logged-in users can trigger the checkout process.

Integration Notes
- This workflow supports the “Add to Cart and Checkout” use case from Section 5.
- Actual PHP implementation will be completed during Teaching Period 1.
